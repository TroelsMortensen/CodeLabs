# Sockets in C#

![socket](Socket.png)

In this short tutorial, you will see how to make a socket connection in C# between a client and a server.  

Multiple clients cannot be handled out of the box, and you must use multi-threading, similarly to what you were taught in SDJ2.  
This is, however, not covered in this tutorial.
