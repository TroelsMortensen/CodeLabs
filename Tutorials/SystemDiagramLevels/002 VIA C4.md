# VIA C4 Version

The next few slides will explain a version of C4 adapted to your projects, with examples.

I will introduce an extra level of abstraction.

Also realize not all diagram-levels are always relevant for your particular system. 
This article will provide tools and guidelines, and you must then apply what you feel is relevant in your project.

But, generally, you should remember to easy your reader into the system design.

I will provide examples of the same four levels, and I have a suggestion for a level 3.5 and 3.8, i.e. two extra levels.\
These are "package diagram" and "low detailed class diagram".

This results in 6 levels of abstractions, again, not all are always relevant. And not all need go into the project report.

3 Components\
3.5 Packages\
3.8 Low detailed class diagram\
4 Code

## Example system

To give examples of the diagrams, we need an example system. This will be a task management system, let's say it is to be used with some variation of Scrum. I will make it simpler for this example though.

You would therefore have different user roles: Product Owner, Developer.\
We need a Project, which has a Product Backlog, containing User Stories.\
We need Sprints, which has User Stories, and Sub-Tasks.

Let's give it a try, and go through each of the diagrams.
