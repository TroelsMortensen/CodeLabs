<p>The purpose of this article is to give you inspiration how to document the design of your system.</p>
<p>Throughout many semester projects I have seen students being unsure which diagrams are needed, how to do them, where to put them. Basically, how best to explain how your system is put together.</p>
<p>This article takes heavy inspiration from the <a href="https://c4model.com/">C4 model for visualising software architecture</a>, but I have adjusted certain things, to make it fit better to our projects. The overall idea is the same, though.</p>
<p>The point is that you can create diagrams of your system at different levels of abstraction. <br />
Consider the class diagram, it is detailed, but may become very large and incomprehensive, if you don't have some prior understanding of where to start looking at the diagram.<br />
Here, different abstractions, and conventions, can really help the reader.</p>
<p>Instead of presenting the class diagram first, it is better to first give the reader a high level overview of the system. Is it a single-user desktop app? Is it client-server? Are there multiple servers?</p>
<p>So, different levels display different relevant information about the system. Usually it is best to start at high levels, zoomed out, and then gradually zoom in with more detailed diagrams.</p>
<p>This article will give examples of the various levels.</p>
<h2 id="c4-real-quick">C4 Real Quick</h2>
<p>The C4 model is named so, because it contains four types of diagrams, at four levels of abstraction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Context</li>
<li>Containers</li>
<li>Components</li>
<li>Code</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="c4-overview.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I realize you can't read the text, but the point remains: You have four levels, and can gradually zoom in, using different diagrams.</p>
<h3 id="context">1 Context</h3>
<p>This is the highest abstraction, it is sort of like a domain model, or a rich picture.<br />
It provides a starting point, showing how the software system in scope fits into the world around it.</p>
<h3 id="container">2 Container</h3>
<p>This diagram zooms into the software system in scope, showing the high-level technical building blocks.<br />
Here you will find the various applications and data stores. E.g. in a client-server system, this diagram would show client, server, and data, with connections between them.</p>
<h3 id="component">3 Component</h3>
<p>Applications are often composed of multiple components. We don't practice this very much at VIA, but a component can be considered a module in Java (or a JAR file), and a project in C# (or exe or dll file).</p>
<h3 id="code">4 Code</h3>
<p>This is your class diagram. Either one large, or by application (client, server, etc). Sometimes by component, but then you do risk the diagram becoming too fragmented to provide value.</p>
<p>Often this diagram is the one, which changes most often, and will involve the most work to keep updated.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="via-c4-version">VIA C4 Version</h1><hr/>
<p>The next few slides will explain a version of C4 adapted to your projects, with examples.</p>
<p>I will introduce an extra level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Also realize not all diagram-levels are always relevant for your particular system.
This article will provide tools and guidelines, and you must then apply what you feel is relevant in your project.</p>
<p>But, generally, you should remember to easy your reader into the system design.</p>
<p>I will provide examples of the same four levels, and I have a suggestion for a level 3.5 and 3.8, i.e. two extra levels.<br />
These are &quot;package diagram&quot; and &quot;low detailed class diagram&quot;.</p>
<p>This results in 6 levels of abstractions, again, not all are always relevant. And not all need go into the project report.</p>
<p>1 Context<br />
2 Containers<br />
3 Components<br />
3.5 Packages<br />
3.8 Low detailed class diagram<br />
4 Code</p>
<h2 id="example-system">Example system</h2>
<p>To give examples of the diagrams, we need an example system. This will be a task management system, let's say it is to be used with some variation of Scrum. I will make it simpler for this example though.</p>
<p>You would therefore have different user roles: Product Owner, Developer.<br />
We need a Project, which has a Product Backlog, containing User Stories.<br />
We need Sprints, which has User Stories, and Sub-Tasks.</p>
<p>Let's give it a try, and go through each of the diagrams.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="context">Context</h1><hr/>
<p>The context sets the scene of the system, introduces the domain.</p>
<p>I feel this belongs more in the analysis part of your report, as it is closer to a domain model or a rich picture.</p>
<p>At some point, we introduced rich pictures on 3rd semester, and this picture could provide context.</p>
<p>I find these pictures are not always easy to draw, because software is somewhat abstract, and be difficult to explain with pictures.
Maybe I just need practices. And some domains are more easily depicted than others.</p>
<p>There are no specific rules as to how you draw this, and you can google many different styles.</p>
<p>Below is an example of the task management system:</p>
