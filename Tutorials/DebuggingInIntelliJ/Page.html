<hr/><h1 id="welcome-to-debugging-in-java-with-intellij-idea">Welcome to debugging in Java with IntelliJ Idea</h1><hr/>
<p>This tutorial will introduce the debugging tool in IntelliJ.
The debugging tool is super powerful, and you will spend much of your professional career using it.<br />
This tutorial is meant as a simple introduction, but should be enough to get you going.<br />
You can't really break anything using the debugger, so I encourage you to play around with it quite often, so that you get intimately comfortable.</p>
<h3 id="generalization">Generalization</h3>
<p>The tutorial can be used for other IDEs as well,
though some descriptions or images will not match, e.g. in Eclipse.<br />
All modern IDEs have some built in debugging tool, so, conceptually, the ideas presented here should be transferable to your preferred IDE.</p>
<p>The same code can be used. The Java version should not be relevant.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="new-project">New Project</h1><hr/>
<p>First, you will need a new Java project. Or a folder in an existing, it's not all that important.<br />
I assume you create a new project, set it up as usual, have a package with a class, containing a main method.</p>
<p>For example like this:</p>
<p><img src="InitialProject.java.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Notice project structure on the left, and the initial code on the right.</p>
<p>You should be able to run the main method, and get a print out. Just to make sure things are set up correctly.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="the-example-classes">The Example Classes</h1><hr/>
<p>The code introduced over the next few slides is what we will use for this example. There are four classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Category</li>
<li>Product</li>
<li>Program</li>
<li>Utils</li>
</ul>
<p>The application is about products and calculating prices, nothing too fancy.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="create-utils-class">Create <code>Utils</code> class</h1><hr/>
<p>Inside your new project, create a class called <code>Utils</code>, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="line-numbers language-java">public class Utils
{
    private static final double vatGrocery = 0.07;
    private static final double vatNormal = 0.19;

    public static double calculateVat(double price, Category category)
    {
        double result;

        if (category == Category.GROCERY)
            result = price * vatGrocery;
        else
            result = price * vatNormal;

        return result;
    }

    public static double calculatePriceWithVat(double price, Category category)
    {
        var priceVat = price + calculateVat(price, category);
        return priceVat;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It is not currently important what the code does, we will step through it and investigate, when we start the debugging.</p>
<p>The class depends on a <code>Category</code>, and your code does not compile, so we will create that next.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="create-category">Create Category</h1><hr/>
<p>The Category is just an enum (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html">read more here</a>), i.e. a fixed list of values.</p>
<p>Create a new class/enum, called <code>Category</code> in the same package as the other two classes (Main, Utils).</p>
<p>The code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="line-numbers language-java">public enum Category {
    ELECTRONICS,
    GROCERY,
    CLOTHES
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>enum</code> type, instead of <code>class</code>, in the first line.<br />
We now have a type called <code>Category</code>, with a set of possible values: [electronics, grocery, clothes].</p>
<p>The convention is to all upper case enum value names.</p>
<p>Your code should now compile again, now that the <code>Utils</code> knows about a <code>Category</code>.</p>
<h3 id="notice">Notice</h3>
<p>When creating a new class, you can actually select it to be an enum:</p>
<p><img src="CreateEnum.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Or, you can just create a normal class, and change our <code>class</code> with <code>enum</code>.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="product-class">Product Class</h1><hr/>
<p>Now we need the <code>Product</code> class, so we can calculate some prices, and taxes, and stuff.</p>
<p>Create a new class called <code>Product</code>, in the same package as the rest.</p>
<p>The code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="line-numbers language-java">public class Product
{
    private String name;
    private Category category;
    private double price;

    public Product(String name, Category category, double price)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.category = category;
        this.price = price;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Category getCategory() {
        return category;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }
}
</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="the-program">The Program</h1><hr/>
<p>Finally, we need to update the <code>Main</code> class, to contain a bit of functionality, we can run.</p>
<p>You need to modify the code to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="line-numbers language-java">public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        showPricesWithVat();
    }

    private static void showPricesWithVat() {
        System.out.println(&quot;Product prices incl. VAT:&quot;);

        for (Product product : products) {
            double vat = Utils.calculateVat(product.getPrice(), product.getCategory());
            double priceWithVat = Math.round(product.getPrice()+ vat);
            System.out.println(product.getName() + &quot;: &quot; + priceWithVat + &quot; EUR&quot;);
        }
    }

    private static final List&lt;Product&gt; products = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(
            new Product(&quot;Batteries&quot;, Category.ELECTRONICS, 2.50),
            new Product(&quot;SD Card&quot;, Category.ELECTRONICS, 10),
            new Product(&quot;T-shirt&quot;, Category.ELECTRONICS, 15),
            new Product(&quot;Parmesan Cheese&quot;, Category.GROCERY, 7.50),
            new Product(&quot;Tomatoes&quot;, Category.GROCERY, 2))
    );
}
</code></pre>
<p>Overall, we have three parts/sections in this code.</p>
<p>First, lines 3-5, this is the <code>main</code> method, it just calls the <code>showPricesWithVat</code> method.<br />
Then, lines 7-15, this is the method which will display products and their prices, the main functionality of our tiny program.<br />
It loops through a list of 5 products, which is defined at the bottom of the class, lines 17-23.</p>
<h3 id="test-run">Test run</h3>
<p>Your program should compile, and you should be able to run it.<br />
This should produce the following output to the console:</p>
<pre><code>Product prices incl. VAT:
Batteries: 3.0 EUR
SD Card: 12.0 EUR
T-shirt: 18.0 EUR
Parmesan Cheese: 8.0 EUR
Tomatoes: 2.0 EUR
</code></pre>

<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="breakpoints">Breakpoints</h1><hr/>
<p>Breakpoints are placed next to lines of code.
When running your program in debug mode (shown later),
your program will pause execution at the break point,
and you can inspect all kinds of information.</p>
<p>Now, suppose we don't like the numbers being calculated, maybe we suspect an error,
and we want to understand how the calculations are made by debugging our program.</p>
<h2 id="setting-a-breakpoint">Setting a breakpoint</h2>
<p>A <strong>breakpoint</strong> is placed in the <em><strong>gutter</strong></em>.
This is the area just to the right of the line numbers in a class, see below.<br />
A breakpoint is a small red dot (( )).<br />
You can theoretically place as many breakpoints, as you wish, all over your program.<br />
A breakpoint is removed by clicking it again.</p>
<p>In our program, all calculation results are shown by
the <code>ShowPricesWithVat</code> method, so, let's put a
breakpoint on the first line of this method,
and run the program in debug mode, like so:</p>
<p>Notice the red dot in the <em>gutter</em> in the gif below.<br />
Then see how the debugging is started by running the program using the little bug button, next to the play button.<br />
Finally, when the code execution hits the line with the breakpoint, the execution is paused, and the line is highlighted.</p>
<p>See this gif:</p>
<p><img src="PlaceBreakpoint.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now, give it a go yourself.</p>
<p>Let the program execution be paused here, and go to the next slide.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="the-debug-window">The Debug Window</h1><hr/>
<p>After we start debugging, the program stops at the breakpoint.
To examine the state of the paused program, we use the Debug window.</p>
<p>This window contains all kinds of information:</p>
<p><img src="DebugWindow.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The debug window should automatically appear at the bottom of IntelliJ, when you run the program in debug mode, and hit a breakpoint.</p>
<ol>
<li>Here we have a few buttons, the relevant are from the top:
<ol>
<li>Curved green arrow: restart program</li>
<li>Green play arrow: resume program from where it is currently pause</li>
<li>Grey pause icon: if your program is running, you can press this button to pause at the current execution point.</li>
<li>Red square: terminate program</li>
<li>At the bottom, the two red dots, this will show a list of all your breakpoints.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The call stack. I.e. which method has called which method, which has then called another method. Basically you can see the trace of methods called to arrive at the current location. In this case we can see the <code>main</code> has called <code>showPricesWithVat</code>.</li>
<li>The debugging tools, used to navigate and control execution of your code. They will be introduced over the next few slides.</li>
<li>The various variables and their values, known at the current breakpoint.</li>
</ol>
<p>While still paused, go to the next slide.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="advancing-code-execution">Advancing Code Execution</h1><hr/>
<p>During debugging we often step through the program one line at a time to examine the program state at various execution points. This is the bread and butter of debuggin.<br />
There are two main ways you can step through the code:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Step Over</code> <kbd>F8</kbd> : if you're not interested in the method, the debugger will execute the call and stop at the next statement after the method call.</li>
<li><code>Step Into</code> <kbd>F7</kbd> : if paused at a line of code which calls a method, you will step inside the method and stop at the beginning of this method.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="StepButtons.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We'll take a look at both shortly.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="stepping-over-code">Stepping Over Code</h1><hr/>
<p>Run your program again, with debugging, it should pause at the break-point here:</p>
<p><img src="Line14breakpoint.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Let's begin with stepping over the <code>Utils.calculateVat(...)</code> method in the for-loop.<br />
We will pause in line 19, i.e. the next print-out, and inspect the information.<br />
It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="StepOverCode.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>These are the steps shown:</p>
<ol>
<li>Program started with debugging, i.e. the little bug-button</li>
<li>Program stops execution at break-point</li>
<li>The execution is advanced one line at a time with the <kbd>Step Over</kbd> button.</li>
<li>After line 17, we can see the value of the <code>vat</code> variable: 0.475</li>
<li>After line 18, we can see the value of the <code>priceWithVat</code> variable: 3.0</li>
<li>Both the values are shown next to the line of code, and also in the inspector at the bottom.</li>
<li>We can also inspect the specific <code>product</code> instance, we are currently working with. It is the &quot;Batteries&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the information, when the program is paused at line 19:</p>
<p><img src="InfoAtLine19.png" alt="" /></p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="stepping-into-code">Stepping Into Code</h1><hr/>
<p>Stepping into code is used when you want to enter the method at the current line of execution, and pause inside that method.</p>
<p>E.g. if you are paused here, at line 17, and want to see what happens inside <code>Utils.calculateVat(..)</code>, you will use the <kbd>Step Into</kbd> button.</p>
<p><img src="PauseAtLine17.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Let's try. Rerun the program, with debugging. It pauses at line 14 (or you can remove the current break-point, and create a new),
step over until the execution is paused at line 17. As shown above.</p>
<p>Now, we want to <kbd>Step Into</kbd>, which means we enter the method <code>calculateVat</code>, and continue from <em>its</em> beginning.</p>
<p>When paused at line 17, press the button, or <kbd>F7</kbd>:</p>
<p><img src="StepIntoButton.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I had to press it twice, first it highlighed the method, then at second press, it entered the method.<br />
The execution is now paused here:</p>
<p><img src="PauseInsideCalcVat.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now, inspect the values in the inspector at the bottom, as you <kbd>Step Over</kbd> until execution exits the method again.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="resuming-the-program">Resuming the Program</h1><hr/>
<p>At any time, you can resume program execution. The program will run till the next breakpoint, if any.</p>
<p>E.g. if you have a loop with several lines of code,
and your are looking for something specific after a couple of iterations,
maybe you don't want to use step-over all the way.
Put a break point at the beginning of the loop, and use <kbd>Resume Program</kbd> to iterate through loops.</p>
<p><img src="ResumeProgramButton.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Let's try it out.</p>
<p>Terminate your program.<br />
Remove your break-points.<br />
Create a new break-point inside <code>calculateVat()</code>, here:</p>
<p><img src="BreakpointInCalcVat.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Run your program, it should pause the your break-point.<br />
When you click <kbd>Resume Program</kbd>, execution stops here again, but this time it is for the second product.
I.e. the second iteration of the for-loop. Pressing <kbd>Resume Program</kbd> again pauses at this line again, now for the third product.</p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="evaluating-expressions">Evaluating Expressions</h1><hr/>
<p>During debugging, you can evaluate any expression in the context of the current execution point. By &quot;evaluate&quot;, I mean &quot;run code&quot;.<br />
Say, we want to evaluate the insides of our <code>if</code>-block:</p>
<p><img src="PauseAt12.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>We can select parts of the code and use the <code>Evaluate expression</code> feature to execute that piece of code, like this:</p>
<p><img src="EvaluateExpression.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can either use the pop-up window, or the input field in the inspector.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can hold down <kbd>alt</kbd> and click on parts of your code for evaluation. Below, <kbd>alt</kbd> is held down. Notice the underline indicating what code is executed, when clicking on it:</p>
<p><img src="HoldDownAlt.gif" alt="" /></p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="adding-watches">Adding Watches</h1><hr/>
<p>If you're interested in how a particular expression changes during program execution, you can add it as a watch. Either a variable, or an expression.<br />
By default, watches are shown together with local variables in the debugging inspector, and updated (if needed) at each step through the application.</p>
<p>Let's add our expression to watches, we can then see how it changes through executions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the expression <code>category == Category.Grocery</code>.</li>
<li>In the context menu (right click), select Add to Watches. Or create a watch manually, see below. Notice the glasses icon next to your watch.</li>
<li>Press <kbd>F9</kbd> or click the <kbd>Resume Program</kbd> button in the Debug window.</li>
<li>Notice how the watched value changes.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="InspectWatch.gif" alt="" /></p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="conditional-break-point">Conditional Break-Point</h1><hr/>
<p>Sometimes, you have a problem with a specific element in a list, and the faulty code is in a for-loop.</p>
<p>You go debugging, place a break-point in the for-loop, and press <kbd>Resume Program</kbd> until the correct element is active.</p>
<p>If there are many elements in the list, it will take a long time to get to the correct element.\</p>
<p>Example: In our case, we want to inspect the calculation for &quot;Parmesan Cheese&quot;, i.e. the fifth element in the list.<br />
I could put a break-point at line 17 in the Main class, i.e. the first line inside the for-loop, and just <kbd>Resume Program</kbd> until &quot;Parmesan Cheese&quot; product is active.<br />
But this could take time.</p>
<p>I have previously hacked this by creating an if-statement, like this:</p>
<p><img src="HackConditionalBreakPoint.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It does work, it will pause execution when <code>product</code> is the &quot;Parmesan Cheese&quot;.<br />
But it is not particularly pretty, and you may forget to clean up.</p>
<p>It is better to create a conditional break-point.<br />
You do this by creating a normal break-point, and right-clicking it.<br />
Now you can insert a condition:</p>
<p><img src="InsertConditionalBP.gif" alt="" /></p>

</div>
<div class="tab">
<hr/><h1 id="the-end">The End</h1><hr/>
<p>That was the introduction to debugging.
This guide is not extensive, but should be enough to get your started on your debugging-journey. This is a common tool available in all modern IDEs, across most programming languages.</p>
<p>Whenever your code does not behave as expected, you should probably start debugging. Put break points before the affected area, and step through the code, inspecting values along the way, until you find something specific.</p>
<p>You will probably often encounter null-pointer exceptions when doing exercises and projects. The exception stack trace should tell you which line of code in which class produce the exception. Put a breakpoint at that line or a few lines before, to inspect what happens up to the expcetion.</p>
<p>Debugging is a powerful tool, and an entire skillset in itself. Mastering this tool is very important.</p>
