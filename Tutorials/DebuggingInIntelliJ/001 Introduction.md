# Welcome to debugging in Java with IntelliJ Idea
This tutorial will introduce the debugging tool in IntelliJ.
The debugging tool is super powerful, and you will spend much of your professional career using it.\
This tutorial is meant as a simple introduction, but should be enough to get you going.\
You can't really break anything using the debugger, so I encourage you to play around with it quite often, so that you get intimately comfortable.



### Generalization
The tutorial can be used for other IDEs as well,
though some descriptions or images will not match, e.g. in Eclipse.\
All modern IDEs have some built in debugging tool, so, conceptually, the ideas presented here should be transferable to your preferred IDE.

The same code can be used. The Java version should not be relevant.
