# Manipulating the database
Now, we have a nice database. But how do we interact with it?

The next couple of slides will cover basic interactions with the database:

* Inserting data
* Updating data
  * Tracked entities
  * Disconnected entities
* Deleting data
* Retrieving data
* Connecting data
  * Through association
  * Through foreign key
* Querying data
  * Simple queries
  * Filtering
  * Sorting
  * Mapping
  * Joining
  * Paging

These upcoming slides will be done later.. eventually. Hopefully.
