# Introduction
This guide aims to explain:
* How to add EFC to your project
* How to configure domain entities by EFC convention
* How to interact with the DbSets of EFC

## The Example
I have <s>stolen</s> borrowed the example from he book Entity Framework Core in Action by Jon P Smith.

It's about books, authors, and reviews. The domain model is simple, but it's enough to show the basics of EFC.\
It also covers each of the relevant relationships:
* One-to-one
* One-to-many
* Many-to-many
* Self-referencing
* Many-to-many with relationships attributes

Here is the ER diagram:
