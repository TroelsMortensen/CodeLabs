```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) AS no_orders
FROM customer c,
     "order" o
WHERE c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 4
ORDER BY no_orders DESC, first_name;
```

Notice here the "order". This table name is in quotes because _order_ is a keyword in SQL.
