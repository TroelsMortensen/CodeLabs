# Load data
In these exercises we will use the data set "Goodreads V2".

You must first import this data set. Download the ddl file from here:

[Goodreads ddl](GoodreadsV2_DDL.sql)

You must import this by running the ddl code, like this:

![img.png](img.png)

Right click on your _schema_ folder, and select the "Run SQL Script...".

This should import a new schema, the "goodreads_v2".

Then, you must import data. Download the data her:

[Goodreads data](GoodreadsV2_Data.sql)

And then run it, in the same way as before. You should now have a "goodreads_v2" schema with data. Verify this.

The below is a Global Relations Diagram to get an overview of the database:

You may want to right click the above, and open the image in a new tab, if it is too small.

Over the following slides, you will be asked questions, which must be answered by querying the dvdrental database.\
All questions can be answered with a single sql statement (consider this a challange), but sometimes it is easier to do multiple statements.

For most questions, you can also find the answer as a hint. Do give it a serious try first, before you look at the answer.
