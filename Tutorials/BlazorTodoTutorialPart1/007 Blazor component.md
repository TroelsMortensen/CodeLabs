# Creating blazor-server component
First, we create the blazor-server component. Right-click your solution folder again, to add a new project:

1) ASP.NET contains everything web, within .NET 
2) Give your project a name
3) Select the type. There is also something called Blazor wasm. But we use **Blazor Server**
4) No authentication, we will create our own later
5) No docker support
6) Create the project

Wonderful.

We will leave the component for now, and move on to data access.
