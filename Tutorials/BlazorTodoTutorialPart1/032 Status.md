Now you have been through the basics of Blazor.

You have seen how to mix html and razor-syntax to dynamically render pages.\
You have seen how to use data-binding to dynamically display information on the pages.\
You have seen how to add event-listeners, so methods are called e.g. when clicking a button, or inserting text in a text field.

These are the basic elements, are you can make quite fancy apps with just this.

The next topic is more advanced, it is about how to use components for reusability in your app. 
Use of components are not strictly necessary, you can get far without, but they make many things much easier.
