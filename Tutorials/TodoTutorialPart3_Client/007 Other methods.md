# Other Methods

We still need three (at least) methods implemented:
* Get Todo by id
* Delete Todo by id
* Update Todo by id

Give them a go by yourself, test along the way.

I suggest you start with Delete, then Get, then Update. That makes it easier to test. 

If you implemented the blazor-component modal to update a Todo, then the GetByID method may not be needed.

Remember, you can see my solution [in this branch](https://github.com/TroelsMortensen/BlazorTodoApp/tree/10HttpClient).

Test by making modifications, and either refreshing or opening another page and go back again to verify then changes stuck.
