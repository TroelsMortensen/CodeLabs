# Introduction

This short tutorial will show how to use Astah to create an EER diagram using UML for your database. 

There are certain relevant tools needed so that you can use a class diagram to document an EER diagram.

We will:

1) use a UML class diagram as the basis.
2) hide various information not needed for EER diagrams. 
3) see how to make relationships, both simple and complex.
4) add relationship attributes.
5) export the diagram as svg.
