# Relationship attributes

These kind of attributes belong to a relationship between two entities.

For example, a `Customer` can buy multiple tickets to some `Event`.\
The number of tickets bought cannot be on neither `Customer`, nor `Event`, but is something which exists for each pair of `Customer` and `Event`.
Therefore, we make it a relationship attribute.

It looks like this:

The full drawn line is the relationship, the dotted line goes to the relationship attributes.
