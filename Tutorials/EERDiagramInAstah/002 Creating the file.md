# Creating the diagram file

When you open Astah, you will most likely see a blank canvas, as no file or diagram is open.

Create a new file:

![img.png](img.png)

Then, right-click the little "P" folder icon. We are going to create a new class diagram:

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

You will notice further down in the above context menu, 
there is actually an option to create an "ER diagram".
However, this will not be UML, but a different notation language.
We don't use that.

We want UML.

So, a class diagram it is.
