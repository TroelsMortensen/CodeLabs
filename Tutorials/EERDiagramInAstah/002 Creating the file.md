# Creating the diagram file

When you open Astah, you will most likely see a blank canvas, as no file or diagram is open.

Create a new file:

Then, right-click the little "P" folder icon. 
We are going to create a _**new class diagram**_:

You will notice further down in the above context menu, 
there is actually an option to create an "ER diagram".
**However, _this will not be UML_, but a different notation language.**

### We don't use that.

We want UML!

## So, a class diagram it is.
