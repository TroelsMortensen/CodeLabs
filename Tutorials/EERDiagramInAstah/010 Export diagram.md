# How to export the diagram

Sometimes these diagrams must be included in a report, or assignment.

It is important to export _all_ your diagrams from Astah as .svg files. This is "scalable vector graphics", which will prevent the diagram from becoming pixelated/blurry in the report pdf document.

This is true for ER/GR diagrams, domain models, class diagrams, activity diagrams, etc.

It is done through this menu option:
