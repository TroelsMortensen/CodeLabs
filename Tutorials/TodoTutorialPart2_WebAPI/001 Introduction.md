# Introduction

This is the second part of my Blazor tutorial. 
We are going to introduce a Web API, to be used by the blazor pages to read/write data.

We will just focus on the Web API for now, and then in Part 3, a client is introduced, so we can make a connection between the Blazor app and the Web API.

The code for the WebAPI can be found [in this branch](https://github.com/TroelsMortensen/BlazorTodoApp/tree/9WebAPI).
