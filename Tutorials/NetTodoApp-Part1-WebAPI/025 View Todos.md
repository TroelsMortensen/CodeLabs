# New Feature: View Todos
We are ready to start on the next feature:

> As a User I can view all or filtered Todos, so that I can remember what to do
 
We wish to get a list of all Todos. We also want to be able to apply filtering. Maybe the user only wishes to see their own, or only un-completed items.\
If a Todo had a deadline, we could add an ordering functionality. But that's in the next version.

Same approach as before:
* Application layer
* Data layer
* Web API layer
