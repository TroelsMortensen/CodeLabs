# Application component

Create another Class Library project, call it Application. You may delete the default class, `Class1.cs`.

This component will house our domain logic. This is where we will validate data from the client application.

We leave it for now. We will focus on implementing a feature at a time, so we will come back to this component, when we start on the first feature.

We still need a bit more setup first, though.
