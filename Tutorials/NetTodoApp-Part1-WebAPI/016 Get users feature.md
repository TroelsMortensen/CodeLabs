# Get All Users

We are ready for the next feature, available in [this branch on GitHub]():

> As a User I can get a list of all existing Users, so that I can assign Todos to them
 
In order to assign a Todo to a user, we need to be able to select between the users, i.e. retrieve them.

We will do a similar approach, with Domain Driven Design:

1) First the application layer
2) Then the Web API layer
3) Then the data access layer

Let's go.
