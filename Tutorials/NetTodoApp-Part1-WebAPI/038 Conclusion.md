# Conclusion

This concludes the tutorial for now. We have implemented 6 user stories in total: create and get for Users, and CRUD for Todos.

The reader may implement update and delete functionality for users, if they wish.

The next part of the tutorial series will continue with a Blazor-WASM client. In part 3 the JSON storage will be swapped out for SQLite and Entity Framework Core.
