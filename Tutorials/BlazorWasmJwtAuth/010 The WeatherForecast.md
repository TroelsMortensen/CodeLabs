# WeatherForecastController

This class came with the Web API project template. We haven't touched it much, but let's use this as a slightly closer real life example.

Open the class.

Put the [Authorized] attribute above the class definition, i.e. line 9 or so. Now, we can only access the GET endpoint with a valid token.

This concludes the Web API part of the tutorial.

Next up, we take a look at the Blazor side of things.
