# Testing the log in
We should now be able to test the login functionality.

Start the Web API.

Start the Blazor app.

In the top right corner of the app, in the grey bar, you should see the Login icon.

Click it.

Type in:\
User name: trmo\
Password: onetwo3FOUR

Click <kbd>Log in</kbd>

Hopefully everything works as intended. You should be shown the home page and notice the login icon changed to a logout icon, i.e. the arrow points out of the rectangle.
