# Adding watches

f you're interested in how a particular expression changes during program execution, 
you can add it to `Watches`. 
By default, watches are shown together with local variables and updated at each step through the application. 
Let's add our expression to `Watches`:

1) Select the expression category == Category.Grocery.
2) In the context menu (right click), select Add to Watches. Or create a watch manually, see below.
3) Press [F9] or click the Resume Program button in the Debug window. 
4) Note how the watched value changes.
