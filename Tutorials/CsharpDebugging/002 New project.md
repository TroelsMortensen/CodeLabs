# The code
The code introduced over the next few slides is what we will use for this example. There are four classes: 
* Category
* Product
* Program
* Utils

The application is about products and calculating prices, nothing too fancy.

### New project
First, you'll need a new console project. It can be in an existing solution, or a new one.
