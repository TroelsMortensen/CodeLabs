# Welcome to debugging in C# with Rider
This tutorial will introduce the debugging tool in Rider. 
The tutorial can be used for other IDEs as well, 
though some descriptions or images will not match, e.g. Visual Studio.

Still, the same code can be used, and the same debugging functionality will most likely exist.
