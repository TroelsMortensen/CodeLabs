# The end

That was the introduction to debugging. This is a common tool available in all modern IDEs, across most programming languages.

Whenever your code does not behave as expected, you should probably start debugging. 
Put break points before the affected area, and step through the code, inspecting values along the way, until you find something specific.

You will probably often encounter null-pointer exceptions when doing exercises and projects. The exception stack trace should tell you which line of code in which class produce the exception.
Put a breakpoint at that line or a few lines before, to inspect what happens up to the expcetion.

Debugging is a powerful tool, and an entire skillset in itself. Mastering this tool is very important.
