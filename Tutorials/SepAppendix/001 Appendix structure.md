# Structuring your appendix in SEP

In SEP it's important to have a good appendix structure, so that the examiner can easily their way around, and don't have to play hide and seek with your documents.

I recommend the following:
* Every file starts with an Id, e.g. A, B, C... and also a name that says something about what the folder contains
* You have a root folder called Appendix
* Inside Appendix you have only folders
* Inside these folders, you can organize your files
  * It can become confusing if you mix folders and files
* It is good to include source files, e.g. your Astah files, but you cannot expect an external examiner to have Astah.\

Generally, all files must also be available as pdf, png, or svg.  

So, what could it cook like?

Now, you can easily make references to your appendix, e.g. "Below you can see a use case description for how to add a new product. Other use case descriptions can be found in Appendix A.A"
