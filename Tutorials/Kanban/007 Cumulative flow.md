# The Cumulative Flow Diagram

In Scrum you have the Burndown Chart, which will give a quick overview of the progress of the project. For every item finished (usually user stories), you burn points, and the chart line will descent.

Kanban has something similar, but with a bit more information. It is called the cumulative flow diagram [[4]](https://ardalis.com/excel-cumulative-flow-diagram/) [[5]](https://getnave.com/blog/how-to-read-the-cumulative-flow-diagram-infographic/).

On the X-axis you have the time, e.g. usually day. Perhaps week. On the Y-axis you have the tasks, in each column.

At a specific point in time (i.e. day), you can see how many tasks are in each column. 

Here is an example with columns "next up", "doing", and "done".

The Done grows steadily over time. The other two grows or shrinks depending on how many tasks are in the respective columns on the board. 
The source above explains how to create the diagram in Excel. I don't think this is common feature in the Kanban apps, though personally, I find the diagram very informative.

Any flat areas indicates that tasks are not moving. In that respect the diagram tells some of the same information as the Burndown Chart.
