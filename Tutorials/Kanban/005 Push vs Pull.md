# Push vs Pull

The boards shown so far have been push systems.
Whenever a task is done in one column, it is moved to the next column. But sometimes this may cause inconveniences. What if the next column has met the WIP limit?\
Your task is then stuck in a sort of limbo. And it may not be entirely obvious that it is actually ready to be moved.

If one person does the task from analysis through implementation, but another tests it, it may not be clear if the task is ready to be tested. 
If the Test column is full, the task is stuck in the previous column. Simple communication might enlighten this, but you may not always be able to get a hold of your team member. 
So, is the task ready to be tested, or...?

The pull system doubles (almost) the columns. After each column is a "parking area", where you can put tasks, which are ready to be _pulled_ into the next column.
For example:

This way, if a person is not taking a task through all columns, but at some point need to hand over to some other team member, it is now clear which tasks are ready to be worked on.
