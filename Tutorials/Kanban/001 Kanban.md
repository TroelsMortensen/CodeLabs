# What is Kanban?
Kanban is a popular Lean workflow management method for defining, managing, 
and improving services that deliver knowledge work. It helps you visualize work, maximize efficiency, 
and improve continuously. Work is represented on Kanban boards, 
allowing you to optimize work delivery across multiple teams and handle even the most complex 
projects in a single environment.

It is an agile project management process, similar to Scrum. There are overlaps, and there are relevant differences. And sometimes teams will combine Scrum and Kanban into variations of "Scrumban".

## Intention
Well, you can find tons of articles, videos, etc online. If you google the title, you'll find many of the sort "Kanban in x minutes". 
Most of them are a great start. And I also feel many of them are missing some relevant elements. 
I have written this guide as an attempt to combine all the various information in one place. This also means I can angle it towards your semester project. 

## Overview
The Kanban board is the center in this process. It is a board with columns, each column holding a task-card. 
These tasks travel from left to right across the board, as they are being worked on. This gives a quick overview of the status.\
You may be familiar with websites like [Trello](https://trello.com/) or [Meistertask](https://www.meistertask.com/da). There are many other similar sites, but I usually see these two in semester projects.

Below is an example board:

There are no team roles, unlike scrum. And there are no meetings. This makes the process simpler, less strict, 
but also harder to do well. 
It does require a bit more discipline.

The following slides will first introduce the very basic idea. Then I will add extra ideas, you can include if you feel like it.
