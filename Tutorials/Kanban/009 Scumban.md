# Scrumban

This name is just a common name for any kind of combination of Scrum and Kanban.

The most obvious approach is to do Scrum, and within each sprint, you use Kanban.

You do the sprint planning meeting at the beginning of a sprint, and you create your sprint backlog with all tasks you want to get done this sprint.\
Those tasks go on the Kanban, and you use the board to manage your sprint.

For the next sprint, you then start a new board.


### Other variations
You can of course combine Scrum and Kanban by taking whichever elements you like from each methodology. 

Maybe you like sprints, because it gives you a "short project", which may be easier to comprehend, and there's a fixed "deadline". Some people like this.
So, you do Kanban and just add sprints.

Maybe you like the roles of Scrum. So, you transfer those to Kanban.

Or maybe you do Kanban, and with regular retrospective meetings.
