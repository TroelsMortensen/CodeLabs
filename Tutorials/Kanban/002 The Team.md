# The Team

![](TheTeam.png)

Kanban says nothing about team roles. All are equal, all are developers. 

However, Kanban just describes the basics, and you may add on top of it as needed.\
You can assign someone to be product owner, or Kanban Master, or project manager, if you like.\
You can assign people to specialties, e.g. back-end or front-end developer (though in SEP this is not recommended).

This is all free for you to setup as you like.
