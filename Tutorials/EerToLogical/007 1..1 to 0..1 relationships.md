# 1..1 to 0..1

This means mandatory on one side, and optional on the other.

We define the mandatory side as parent (1..1 side), and the optional as child (0..1 side).

The result will be a relation per entity.

We post the `{PK}` of the parent into the child.

Example:

Here, EntityA is parent, and EntityB is child.

And the resulting relations:
