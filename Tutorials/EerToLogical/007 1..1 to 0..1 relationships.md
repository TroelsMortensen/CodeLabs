# 1..1 to 0..1

This means mandatory on one side, and optional on the other.

We define the mandatory side as parent, and the optional as child.

The result will be a relation per entity.

We post the {PK} of the parent into the child.

Example:

Here, EntityA is parent, and EntityB is child.

And the resulting relations:
