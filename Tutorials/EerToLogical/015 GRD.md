# Global Relations Diagram

Once the relational schema is created, you can convert it into a Global Relations Diagram.

Such a diagram is often better for understanding the structure of the database.

It looks very similar to the EER diagram, but now it just presents the information from the relational schema.

The GRD includes:
* Entities/relations
* relationships, marked with multiplicities on both ends, an arrow pointing to the referenced table, and a name
* Primary keys
* Foreign keys
* Alternate keys

We no longer have:
* Relationship attributes

* Multivalued attributes
* Composite attributes
* Inheritance
* Aggregation
* Composition
