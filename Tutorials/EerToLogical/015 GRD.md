# Global Relations Diagram

Once the relational schema is created, you can convert it into a Global Relations Diagram.

Such a diagram is often better for understanding the structure of the database.

It looks very similar to the EER diagram, but now it just presents the information from the relational schema.

The GRD includes:
* Entities/relations
* relationships, marked with multiplicities on both ends, an arrow pointing to the referenced table, and a name
* Primary keys
* Foreign keys
* Alternate keys

We no longer have:
* Relationship attributes
* \*:* relationships
* Multivalued attributes
* Composite attributes
* Inheritance
* Aggregation
* Composition

Below is an example. First the EER diagram:

Following the steps for mapping, we arrive at the following relational schema:

This relational schema can then be expressed as a Global Relations Diagram:

There are a few tricks for readability:
* All relationship reading directions points in the direction of the foreign key. E.g. Dependent references Employee, so the arrow points from Dependent to Employee.
* The relationship arrows are anchored at specific attributes, instead of the box for the Entity. This also helps to indicate which foreign key points to which primary key.

Draw.IO can handle the attribute anchoring decently. Astah cannot, that's more tedious to work with.
