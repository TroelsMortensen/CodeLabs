# 0..1 to 0..1

Optional on both sides.

It is mapped the same way as 1..1 : 0..1, however it is not clear which entity is parent, and which is child.

Based on knowledge about the domain, you will have to assign parent and child.

The goal is to minimize the number of {FK} cells containing `null`.

Assume the following entities:

![](OptionalOptional1to1.svg)

If EntityA _most_ of the time has an EntityB, and EntityB only sometimes has an EntityA, then we say EntityA is the child, and will contain the foreign key.\
EntityA will then _most_ of the time have a non-`null` value in the cell for the foreign key.

If it is the other way around, then the foreign key goes into EntityB.

You will have to make the choice.

If it's even how often the foreign key will be `null`, you make a choice.

### Example

![](StaffDepartmentEntityExample.svg)

This diagram indicates that a member of Staff may lead 1 Department, and a Department may sometimes be lead by a member of the Staff.
But for whatever reason, in very rare occasions a Department is leader-less.

In this case, we would define Department to be the child, and Staff to be parent: The Department relation will get a foreign key to Staff.
