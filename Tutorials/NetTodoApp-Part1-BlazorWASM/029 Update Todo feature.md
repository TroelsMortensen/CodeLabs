# Updating a Todo Item
New feature. We are working towards CRUD operations for the Todo, i.e. create, read, update, delete.

And we currently have create, and read. Now it is time to update Todos, because we want to be able to mark something as completed.

> As a User I can complete a Todo, so that I can mark things as done

We want to be able to change the completed status. And we also want to be able to change the owner, so that a Todo can be reassigned.\
This means we want to be able to send a Todo item to the server, have it verify the data, and then update an existing Todo.

Same approach, application first, then data layer, and then Web API.
