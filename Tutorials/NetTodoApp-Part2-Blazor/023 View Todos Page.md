# View All Todos Page

First, create a new Blazor page in the Pages directory. Call it "ViewTodos".

This page is going to be a bit more complicated, we will expand it over a few iterations.

Initially it will just display all Todos.\
Then we add filtering functionality.\
Then the next user story is about completing a Todo, so we expand this page for that.\
We will also be able to delete Todos.\
We can edit Todos.\
And finally we will show a popup.

All these things, one thing at a time.


First, just display all Todos.
