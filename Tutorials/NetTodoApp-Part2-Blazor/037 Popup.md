# Creating a Popup
Currently whenever you have successfully added a Todo, you are just being navigated to the View Todos page. A user might be confused, because no success message was displayed first.

We are going to create a success message shown in a popup. The popup will be a component, and the content and functionality of the popup will be arguments to the component.

The purpose of this functionality is to show another way of passing data to a component.
