# Edit Todo Popup

Here's a challenge for you, if you are brave enough, the tutorial will not contain the code for this.

Your task:

* Currently, when you click the Edit icon on ViewTodos, you are taken to a new page, where you can edit a todo.
* Instead, when clicking this icon, a popup should be shown, where you can edit the todo.
* It should contain the same input fields, and functionality.
* When the accept button is clicked:
  * On success, close the popup
  * On failure display an error message inside the popup.
