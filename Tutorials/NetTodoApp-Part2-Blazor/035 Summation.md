# What Have We Done So Far?

We started out with six user stories:

1) As a user of the system I can add a new User, so that Todos can be assigned to Users.
2) As a User I can get a list of all existing Users, so that I can assign Todos to them
3) As a User I can add a new Todo, so that I can remember important things
4) As a User I can view all or filtered Todos, so that I can remember what to do
5) As a User I can complete a Todo, so that I can mark things as done
6) As a User I can delete a Todo, so that I can clean up

We have now implemented these, along with an extra feature to edit a Todo.

We have seen how to define different views with pages.\
We have seen how to dynamically generate a view using HTML and razor syntax.\
We have used the HttpClient to make requests of the Web API.

And with this you're pretty well off to start your Blazor-WASM adventure.

But there are a bit more complexity to be explored with regards to blazor components. The next few slides will core more elaborate component usage.
